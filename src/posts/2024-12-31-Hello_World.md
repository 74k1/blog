Welcome to my corner of the web.

After much tinkering and tweaking, I'm excited to finally launch <span class="accent2">my personal website</span>.

While there's always room for optimization, I've reached a point where I'm ready to share it with the world.

This site is built using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written in Haskell, running on <span class="accent1">NixOS</span>. I owe a debt of gratitude to [rpearce's hakyll-nix-template](https://github.com/rpearce/hakyll-nix-template), which provided an excellent foundation for this project.

Though the setup required some configuration work, everything fell into place nicely. And now, I'm thrilled to present my <span class="accent2">very first</span> blog post!

## What's in Store?

You can expect me to post about <span class="accent1">awesome FOSS projects</span> I discover, <span class="accent1">services</span> I've selfhosted, <span class="accent1">security-related</span> topics, and whatever else comes to mind. For now though, I just needed to get a website up and running so I can actually start blogging.

I'm <span class="accent2">excited</span> for what's to come, and you should be too!

You can subscribe to the blog with RSS:
